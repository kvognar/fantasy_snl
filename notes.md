Necessary Pages for FSNL

EPISODE pages:
- ~~Individual cast member scores (with links to their individual pages)~~
- ~~My write-up (the ones I’ve been posting to Tumblr, which will soon relocate to this site)~~
- Photos from the episode
* Link(s) to my favorite sketch(es)

CAST MEMBER pages:
- ~~Their individual scores by episode (with score breakdown in the x/y/z + whatever format, with links to the episode page)~~
- Brief bio + ~~photos~~
* Videos of choice sketches from them this season
* Something to indicate if they were the “winner” of a given episode

Things marked with a - are necessary, things marked with a * are just other ideas.
And then of course a table of contents page for each. Episodes and cast members. Ideally with photos.

LEAGUES
MY TEAM:
- ~~Photos of your team~~ with their current point totals (and links to their individual cast member pages)
- ~~It would also show your points from episode by episode~~

MY LEAGUE:
- ~~A list of all the players with all their teams, ordered from most points to least points. All that’s there is their team and their current point total. We don’t need every episode or every cast member, that’s what the individual pages are for.~~
- Photos of their cast members.
- ~~Links to their individual MY TEAM page with the point breakdowns~~
